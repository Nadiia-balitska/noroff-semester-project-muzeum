The Community Science Museum project is a semester-long web development assignment aimed at creating an engaging and accessible museum website. The goal was to design and develop a responsive, user-friendly, and aesthetically appealing website that aligns with the provided Figma design and meets accessibility standards.
The project was developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript while ensuring a desctop-first approach. The website includes multiple sections such as exhibits, events, and an interactive navigation system to improve user experience. Additionally, mobile-menu.js was integrated for smooth opening modal menu, and GitHub was used for version control and collaboration.
The project was planned using GitHub Project Board, where tasks were created and tracked to ensure a structured workflow. Image optimization techniques were applied to keep file sizes below 200kb, ensuring a fast and efficient loading experience. The website was designed to be fully responsive, adapting seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
